For example, if you plot total explained variance for $m$ ranging from $1$ to $100$ (or perhaps even 50), you are likely to see a clear elbow. Assume you identify 30 as a tentative value. To find the best choice for $m$, you can compute the adjusted Rand index of the corresponding clustering for all values of $m$ in a neighbourhood of $30$ (e.g., in the range $\\{25,\\ldots , 35\\}$) and pick the value for which the index is maximum. This is just a simple heuristic, given to you as an example. If you think you found a better one you are free to use it, but you should briefly explain how it works. You are encouraged to use more principled heuristics proposed in the literature to choose $m$, in which case you should provide references about.\n",
